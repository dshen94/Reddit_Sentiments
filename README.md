# Reddit_Sentiments

An ongoing simple project to apply sentiment analysis to comments from the most popular subreddits from the website Reddit.com
The project uses the PRAW api wrapper in order to retrieve Reddit data and NLTK in order to perform sentiment analysis.

Stage 1 (completed):
- Build tools to interact with Reddit and store retrieved information from popular subreddits in a database
- Write function to analyze sentiment of each retrieved comment

Stage 2:
- Analyze comment sentiment data and apply statistical analysis to attempt to yield valuable insight
- Create dynamic graphical representation of the data using D3 Javascript library
